* Code Breaker in Emacs-Lisp

An implementation of the Code Breaker game in Emacs Lisp.


* Install and Play

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load "path/to/codebreaker.el")
(cb/play-game)
#+end_src

Run the above from inside Emacs and have fun.

* Playing the Game

When you run =cb/play-game=,  Emacs will open (or switch to) the code breaker buffer and await your input.
You then enter a guess consisting of four letters representing one of the following colored pegs: (R)ed, (B)lue, (G)reen, (Y)ellow, (W)hite and (P)urple.
Emacs will print your guess followed by two numbers.
The first number indicates the number of pegs of the correct color and position;
the second number indicates  number of pegs of correct color but wrong position.
It then waits for your next input.
The game exits when you guess correctly, showing how many tries it took to break the code.
